# About Us

Stract is an open source search engine where the user has the ability to see
exactly what is going on and customize almost everything about their search
results. It's a search engine made for hackers and tinkerers just like
ourselves. No more searches where some of the terms in the query arent used, and
the engine tries to guess what you _really_ meant. You get what you search for.

## Our Values

- _Complete transparency_ -- You can view our code and follow the development
  directly on [Github](https://github.com/StractOrg/stract)
- _Privacy focussed_ -- We will never track you. Period. And you can always
  verify this in our [source code.](https://github.com/StractOrg/stract)
- _Immensely customizable_ -- We aim to give you the ability to customize
  everything about the search. You can block sites, boost sites, prioritize
  links from specific sites and much, much more.

Oh, and if we ever become evil (maybe by changing our motto) please take our
code and start a competitor. The fact that you have this ability will make sure
that our values will always be aligned with our users.

## How do we make money?

In the past, we've been very fortunate to receive an incredible grant from [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/project/Stract/) with financial support from the European Commission's [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu) program.

In the future we will have, clearly labelled, contextual ads based on your current search query and a
subscription option without ads. Just to re-iterate; we will only use your
current search to match ads and will never track you across searches.

We will also have a paid api for developers.
